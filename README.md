# Project title: Explore US Bikeshare Data with Pandas in Python

The **project** was created on the **22nd April 2022**, this **README file** was created on the **27th April 2022**.

### Description
This project explores a six month long bikeshare dataset from three United States cities (Chicago, Washington, and New York City) using pandas in python.

Each city has the following columns in the dataset:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

However, Chicago and New York City have two additional columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

### The aim of the project: 
_**To compute statistics given interactive user inputs to filter the data for outputs such as**_:

1. Popular times of travel 
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3. Trip duration
* min travel time
* average travel time
* total travel time

4. User info
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago) 
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

_You can run the script using any **Python integrated development environment (IDE)**, just ensure you have all files in one folder
